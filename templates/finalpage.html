		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. Deep learning algorithms are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information, allowing the network to learn and improve with more data.

			<br><br>
			The success of deep learning is largely attributed to the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computing resources, and advances in algorithms and architecture design. Deep learning models can automatically extract and learn relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
			<br><br>
			Deep learning has applications in various fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. It has contributed to significant advances in image and speech recognition, language translation, and medical diagnosis, among other domains.</p>
			<br>
		<h2>Technologies</h2>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These systems can learn, reason, perceive, and adapt to new situations.
			<br><br>
			AI technology is used in a wide range of applications, from virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and advanced medical diagnostics. It is also used in industries such as finance, manufacturing, and agriculture to optimize processes and increase efficiency.
			<br><br>
			Some of the key technologies that are used in AI include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Machine learning is the process of training computer systems to learn from data, while natural language processing involves teaching computers to understand and process human language. Computer vision involves teaching computers to interpret and analyze visual information, while robotics involves the development of machines that can sense and respond to their environment.
			<br><br>
			As AI technology continues to advance, it is expected to play an increasingly important role in society and transform the way we live and work. However, it also raises important ethical and societal concerns, such as privacy, bias, and job displacement, that must be carefully addressed.</p>
